### Data Description
The dataset consists of email texts labeled as 'Safe' or 'Phishing'. Features extracted include text-based characteristics and URL analysis to assess the legitimacy of links contained within the emails.

### Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, identifying outliers, and generating word clouds for keyword analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques like TF-IDF vectorization, Word Embeddings, and N-Grams were employed.
- **Model Building:** Various machine learning models were evaluated including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM, followed by deep learning models.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models to improve the detection accuracy.

### Results
- The models achieved a high accuracy rate in distinguishing between phishing and safe emails.
- Ensemble methods provided a significant boost in precision and reliability.

### Future Work
- Further refine the models with additional data.
- Implement real-time phishing email detection.
